Hi, I'm Mayank! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m deeply passionate about Robotics, Computational Mechanics, and AI for Control Systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotic path planning, trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning for control, and numerical simulations.

Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve worked on robot kinematics, dynamics, and control, diving deep into ROS, Gazebo, and Computational modeling. I've been fortunate to work on projects involving Manipulator Kinematics (Open Manipulator X, Orangewood 6 DOF), SCARA and RRR Jacobian derivations, and CFD simulations of airfoil flows. Iâ€™ve also tackled FEA of mechanical components, with applications in ATV design and structural analysis.

Beyond research, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in leadership rolesâ€”serving as Events Executive for Amalthea, leading Documentation and Outreach for the Student Academic Council, and coordinating academic-industrial initiatives at IIT Gandhinagar.

In 2024, Iâ€™m honing my expertise in Control Systems, Machine Learning, Computational Fluid Dyanmics, and Robotics. Iâ€™m also exploring quantitative finance, working on stochastic modeling and analytics. My long-term goal? To blend AI with robotics for real-world automation challenges.

Beyond my core research interests, I actively pursue side quests that keep me engaged and constantly learning. Iâ€™m diving into competitive programming, currently a Newbie on Codeforces with a 20-day streak and counting, sharpening my problem-solving skills. My enthusiasm for Deep Learning led me to complete Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialization, and Iâ€™m now exploring Reinforcement Learning for robotic control. As a ROS & simulation geek, Iâ€™ve built custom URDF/XACRO files, simulated manipulators, and developed trajectory planners to bring robotic systems to life in virtual environments. I also thrive in tech and leadership roles, having helped bring Amalthea back offline, contributed to MetaIITGN, and led outreach initiatives, bridging the gap between academia and industry.

Outside work, I find joy in reading blogs about DSA and Competiev Prgramming, experimenting with Computational Simulations and Numerical Methods, and hitting the gym to build an aesthetic physique!
