Hi, I'm Mayank! üëã

I‚Äôm deeply passionate about Robotics, Computational Mechanics, and AI for Control Systems. My research interests lie at the intersection of robotic path planning, trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning for control, and numerical simulations.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked on robot kinematics, dynamics, and control, diving deep into ROS, Gazebo, and computational modeling. I've been fortunate to work on projects involving Manipulator Kinematics (Open Manipulator X, Orangewood 6 DOF), SCARA and RRR Jacobian derivations, and CFD simulations of airfoil flows. I‚Äôve also tackled FEA of mechanical components, with applications in ATV design and structural analysis.

Beyond research, I‚Äôve been actively involved in leadership roles‚Äîserving as Events Executive for Amalthea, leading Documentation and Outreach for the Student Academic Council, and coordinating academic-industrial initiatives at IIT Gandhinagar.

In 2024, I‚Äôm honing my expertise in Control Systems, Probabilistic ML, and Computational Robotics. I‚Äôm also exploring quantitative finance, working on stochastic modeling and analytics. My long-term goal? To blend AI with robotics for real-world automation challenges.
